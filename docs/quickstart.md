# Quick start

To import external files into your media library, you must enter the URLs of the files in the input field.

## Requirements

* The URLs must be accessible from your WordPress.
* The file types (e.g. PDF, JPEG ...) behind the URLs must be permitted in the plugin settings.

## Example

`https://example.com/file.pdf`

**You can also specify multiple files, even from different URLs:**

`https://example.com/file.pdf
https://example-instrustry.com/file-trust.pdf`

Then click on the button to add the files. Wait a moment until the response is displayed.
